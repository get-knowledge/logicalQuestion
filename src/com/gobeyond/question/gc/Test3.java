/**
 * 
 *   After execution of line 12, t1 becomes eligible for garbage collection.
 *   So when we call garbage collector at line 15, Garbage Collector will call finalize() method on t1 before destroying it.
 *   But in finalize method, in line 38, we are again referencing the same object by t, 
 *   so after execution of line 38,this object is no longer eligible for garbage collection. 
 *   Hence, Garbage Collector will not destroy the object.

	Now again in line 21, we are making same object eligible for garbage collection one more time. 
	Here, we have to clear about one fact about Garbage Collector i.e. 
	it will call finalize() method on a particular object exactly one time. 
	Since on this object, finalize() method is already called,
	so now Garbage Collector will destroy it without calling finalize() method again.
