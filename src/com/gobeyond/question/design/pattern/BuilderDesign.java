//Reduction in multiple constructors. Only one constructor that accepts Builder object is required.

//There is no need to pass null for optional parameters to the constructor.

//Object is instantiated fully i.e. in a complete state. We always get an immutable object since we didnâ€™t provide any setter methods and hence state of object once created cannot be changed.

//Lesser error prone as user would know what they are passing in each method call. This also gives design flexibility and more readable of client code.
